The elements in an associative container are ordered and accessed by key. The
associative containers support efficient lookup and retrieval of elements by key. The use
of a key distinguishes them from the sequential containers, in which elements are
accessed positionally.
The map and multimap types store elements that are keyvalue pairs. These types use the
library pair class, defined in the utility header, to represent these pairs. Dereferencing a
map or multimap iterator yields a value that is a pair. The first member of the pair is a
const key, and the second member is a value associated with that key. The set and
multiset types store keys. The map and set types allow only one element with a given key.
The multimap and multiset types allow multiple elements with the same key.
